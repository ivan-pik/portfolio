<div class="project__long-description">
  <p>My client acquired a user experience agency ExperienceU and they approached me to design a new website based on their wire&#8209;frames and to provide front&#8209;end development. The websiteâ€™s goal was straightforward: present spectrum of offered UX disciplines, spark interest in potential clients and get them in touch. I also simplified the existing logo and created a basic visual identity&nbsp;set.
